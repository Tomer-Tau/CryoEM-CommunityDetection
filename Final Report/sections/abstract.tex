Single-particle reconstruction in \acrfull{cryo-EM}\cite{9016106} is a tool for constructing a 3D model of a biological macromolecule using 2D projections of the macromolecules taken by an electron microscope. An unsupervised classification of the 2D images is required in order to separate macromolecular projections of different conformations. Due to high noise levels and data heterogeneity, sophisticated clustering methods are needed. \\
In our project we will use \acrfull{CD} algorithms to cluster data generated from the \acrfull{MRA} statistical model. The model abstracts away much of the intricacy of \acrshort{cryo-EM} while retaining some of its essential features. \color{red}{Conclusions should be added}
